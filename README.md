Arificial Neural Network 
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning (ML), which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence (AI).

Deep learning is a particular kind of machine learning that achieves great power and flexibility by learning to represent the world as a nested hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined in relation to simpler concepts, and more abstract representations computed in terms of less abstract ones.
